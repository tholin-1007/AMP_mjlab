"""HoST curriculum terms: the "training wheels".

Getting a humanoid to stand up from the floor is hard enough that HoST starts
the task easier than it really is and then progressively removes the help. Two
wheels are used:

1. ``action_scale`` -- the PD position target is
   ``dof_pos + action * action_rescale``; while a small rescaler makes the
   robot sluggish it is also much easier to control. HoST starts at
   ``control.action_scale`` (= 1.0) and, every time the resetting environments
   have reached ``threshold_height`` on average, drops it by 0.02 down to 0.25.
2. ``pull_force`` -- a vertical force of ``curriculum.force`` (100 N, doubled
   because HoST's URDF has two torso links, so 200 N ~= 60 % of G1's weight) is
   applied to the torso while the base is still tipped over. It decays by 20 N
   on the same trigger, down to 0.

Both triggers are HoST's ``update_force_curriculum``:

.. code-block:: python

    if torch.mean(self.old_headheight[env_ids]) > self.cfg.curriculum.threshold_height:
        self.force[env_ids] -= 20
        self.action_rescale[env_ids] -= 0.02

NOTE: HoST keeps ``force`` and ``action_rescale`` as per-environment tensors.
The port keeps the per-env state in :mod:`..mdp.pull_force` /
``_host_action_rescale`` but applies the decay from the mean over the resetting
environments, because mjlab's curriculum terms are called with ``env_ids`` on
reset only -- the observable behaviour (one global decay step per reset batch)
is what a single-process run of HoST produces as well.
