"""HoST's vertical pull force -- the second training wheel.

HoST applies an upward force on the torso while the robot is still tipped over
(``projected_gravity[:, 2] < -0.8``, i.e. "lying down"), and only after the
motors are switched on. The force decays to zero as the policy learns, so the
robot ends up getting up entirely on its own.

Config in HoST::

    class curriculum:
        pull_force = True
        force = 100      # x2 because the URDF carries a real and a virtual torso
        threshold_height = 0.9
        no_orientation = False

so the force actually applied is 200 N, roughly 60 % of a G1's weight.

NOTE: applying an external wrench every physics step needs a hook that this
port cannot verify offline -- ``mjlab`` is a pip dependency (``mjlab==1.2.0``,
Linux only) and is not installed in the environment this port was written in.
``apply_pull_force`` therefore resolves the writer at runtime and fails with an
explicit message naming the hook point. The env config ships with
``pull_force.force = 0`` so training runs without it; switch it on once the hook
is confirmed.
